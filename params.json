{"name":"Muview2","tagline":"3D visualization of micromagnetic simulation data from Mumax or OOMMF","body":"### Muview2\r\n\r\nMuView2 is an OVF (version 1 and 2) compatible viewer intended to function with Mumax and OOMMF. The viewer provides a fast QT/OpenGL interface that enables users to scrub through loaded files with an animation timeline, eliminating the need for manually generating image sequences and rendering animations using several third party software packages.\r\n\r\n### Current Features\r\n- Interactive 3D view of vector and scalar inputs (of arbitrary type)\r\n- Slicing for viewing cross-sections of the geometry\r\n- Easy scrubbing (with automatic caching) through loaded files\r\n- Watch folders such that Muview displays new files when they are created\r\n- Save image sequences directly from the loaded set of files\r\n- Copy images to clipboard or save to file\r\n\r\nFiles may be loaded from command line using standard globbing\r\n```\r\nmuview SpinTorqueOscillator.out/m*.ovf\r\nmuview OOMMF-Data/Oxs*.omf\r\n```\r\nOtherwise, groups of files or entire directories can be loaded from the GUI.\r\n\r\n### Planned Features\r\nPlease let me know what would be useful! I don't plan to add any analysis capabilities.\r\n* More complete image export preferences\r\n* Finish wiring color controls","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
